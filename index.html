          <h1>Caleb Kartha Bortles.</h1>
          <h3>I want to help build a better world.</h3>
          <p>I believe that to create great solutions, development teams must be immersed in the client's community, highly adaptable, and increasingly multidisciplinary.</p>
          <p>That's why as a recent graduate of Michigan State's Mechanical Engineering program, I have worked build a skillset designing, marketing and commercializing products, integrating steps across the product development lifecycle.</p>
