          <h3>Let's build a better world.</h3>
          <p>I believe that to create great solutions, development teams must be immersed in the client's community, highly adaptable, and increasingly multidisciplinary.</p>
          <p>That's why as a recent graduate of Michigan State's Mechanical Engineering program, I have worked build a skillset designing, marketing and commercializing products, integrating steps across the product development lifecycle.</p>

        <h2>It's one thing to have an idea. It's another to bring it to life.</h2> 
        <!-- <h2>I've learned that creating something is one thing, but bringing it to life is a whole other process.</h2> -->
        <!-- <p>Having been shaped by my problem-solving experiences, and being raised in an entrepreneurial environment</p> -->
        <!-- <h3>I knew that I wanted to be able to have the skills not only to create but to </h3> -->
        <!-- <p>I've used my degree at Michigan State building a robust skillset for problem solving and gaining experience bridging those solutions with reality.</p> -->
        <img src="images/pfpv2.jpg" alt="Profile of Caleb Kartha Bortles">
        <p>Problem solving started early for me. What began as Destination Imagination and FIRST Robotics in primary and secondary school put me on the path for a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Michigan State University. However, growing up in an entrepreneurial household taught me that even great ideas need a good plan behind them to succeed. This led me to develop my entrepreneurial skills through coursework and my internship at MSU Technologies so I can build and tailor actionable ideas to a defined market fit.</p>
        
        <!-- <p>From these experiences, I've developed a number of skills, some of which I've shown here:</p>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li></li>
            </ul>

        </div> -->
        <!-- <p>From these experiences, I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering at MSU so I could build strong, foundational engineering skills, and I found particular interest in mechatronic systems, computer aided modeling, and fluid dynamics through my degree. I also made sure to develop experience coding experience, as I believe it is an essential tool for problem solvers of all types in the modern age. </p>
        <p>Taking courses in entrepreneurship added additional perspective, enabling me not only to make a business out of an idea, but also to build and tailor actionable ideas with a defined market fit. Through these courses, I learned about iterative business model development, entrepreneurial marketing, financial documents, and accounting processes, as well hoe to pitch an idea. </p>
        <p>Working at MSU Technologies (MSUT) was the perfect opportunity for me to tie all these experiences together. MSUT is the Technology Transfer Office for MSU and afforded me the opportunity to review and assess state-of-the-art research for commercialization. Our process involved assessing the technology’s readiness, value proposition, IP standing and market fit, and brought me up close and personal with technology development and commercialization. Seeing innovative technologies and being integrated into their development process taught me a lot about my own development processes, and how I could optimize them to build more valuable solutions faster.</p>
        <p>I've worked to broaden my skillset as well as develop more specialized experience, and as a Technology Commercialization Intern at MSU Technologies, I worked on 18 projects </p> -->
