                <h1>MSU Technologies</h1>
                <p>During my time at MSU Technologies, I worked on 18 projects covering a variety of industries. For these disclosures, I would perform patentability searches to assess the presence of prior art, review industry information to determine level of market interest, and assess the level of development, ease of implementation, and startup potential of a given technology. Working in cooperation with the technology manager, I would present my research, assessment, and suggested path for commercialization of the technology to the MSUT board, which was composed of the MSUT technology managers, directors, legal team, and finance team, as well as entrepreneurs-in-residence from the Innovation Center. </p>

                <img src="../images/streamplotforweb.PNG.jpg" alt="Streamplot of Lid-Driven Cavity Project">
                <p>This project was a numerical solution of the Lid Driven Cavity CFD benchmark problem coded in Python. I was able to improve runtime by using NumPy stencil operations, which allowed me to run a generic discretized formula over a grid up to 50 times faster than using a set of for loops. I plan to use this project as a tool to learn parallelization using Dask and Julia in the near future.</p>

                <img src="../images/Segway.png" alt="Image of Mini Segway platform used in my Mechatronics class.">
                <p>This project used a Mini Segway platform to teach common Mechatronics problem solving methods, which was used to learn more about modeling combined electronic and mechanical systems, sensor fusion, and PID control. These lessons were reinforced through system modeling using MATLAB and Simulink, as well as implementing PID control for the pitch angle and speed of the Segway, which was used to control the platform.  </p>
                <!-- The Segway platform consisted of a MKR-1000 Arduino board, MKR motor carrier, a MPU 6050 sensor chip with a 3 axis accelerometer and 3 axis gyroscope, two brushless DC motors with encoders -->

                <h1>Binder Jet Printer Mixing System</h1>
                <img src="../images/deposition.png" alt="Powder/Binder mixing and deposition system for a binder jet 3D printer">
                <p>For this project, I collaborated with a group of students to design an automated mixer and deposition system, intended for use in our professorâ€™s 3D printing system. The 3D printing system is resin-powder based and uses a metal or ceramic powder which is combined with a binding agent for formation of a part. As the binding agent tends to separate from the powder, the mixture needs to be mixed until just before it is deposited. Our team developed the only mixing system which could operate either as a batch mixer or continuous mixer, and proposed future improvements to the system, as the system could not be built by our team due to the COVID-19 outbreak. </p>
